# Description
The Bananagrams Solver calculates the solution to the Bananagrams game. 

Bananagrams is a word game similar to Scrabble, invented by Abraham Nathanson in 2006.  From a bag of 144 lettered tiles, each player randomly picks the predetermined number of tiles (usually 21 letters). The game's goal for each player is to use all of the given letters by creating a word grid of intersecting or interlocking letters that form valid English words. Players can rearrange their grid as many times as they like. The player that uses up all of their tiles first, wins the game. The major skill required for this game is the ability to create anagram words formed by rearranging the letters by using all the original letters exactly once.
